# Grubhub-Email-Searcher
A Google App Script that searches through an email inbox for tagged Grubhub emails, and parses the information to a spreadsheet through a button in the sheet itself. Displays the food item, cost, date of order, and restaurant. Original README shown for others to edit code as they wish. This was my intro to Google's API so maybe it could be yours!
